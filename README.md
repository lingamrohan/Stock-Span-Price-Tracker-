# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Span & Price Tracker

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used
- Stack
- Queue
- Sliding Window
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

---

## ðŸš€ Project Description

This is a beginner-friendly Python project to simulate a basic **stock market analysis tool**. It includes:

1. **Stock Span Calculator**: Determines how many consecutive days before the current day the stock price was less than or equal to today's price. Useful for short-term trend analysis.

2. **Moving Average Calculator**: Computes the moving average of stock prices over a configurable number of past days (sliding window), commonly used to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

These implementations are great for learning how to apply DSA concepts like **stacks** and **queues** in real-world-like problems.

- âœ… Queue-based sliding window for real-time moving average
- âœ… Clean CLI output with easy-to-follow results
- âœ… Pure Python, no external libraries needed
